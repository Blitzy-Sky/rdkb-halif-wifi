# WHAT THIS SCRIPT ENFORCES, stated because a developer running it should be able to read
# what it refuses and why. Every check below ends in a message on stderr and a non-zero
# exit status - never a warning, never a fallback - and nothing is generated when one
# fails. Seven controls, each closing a way this build could otherwise be turned into
# arbitrary code execution or a disclosure:
#
#   1. INPUT. PROJECT_VERSION comes from `git describe --tags`, which is repository data
#      rather than a trusted constant. make expands a command-line variable RECURSIVELY
#      and exports it into every recipe's shell, so a tag named `v$(SSH_PRIVATE_KEY)` or
#      `v$(shell touch /tmp/x)` is expanded or executed by make rather than printed, and
#      shell quoting does not prevent it because make re-expands the value after the shell
#      has finished with it. `git check-ref-format` accepts both of those tag names, so
#      they are valid input rather than malformed input. The version and the site title are
#      therefore accepted only from the character set a version and a title need, bounded
#      in length, refused when they begin with '-', and passed to make quoted.
#   2. PROVENANCE. The generator checkout must come from the official repository, decided
#      by remote HOST AND PATH rather than by equality with one spelling of the URL: a
#      substring or suffix comparison also accepts
#      https://evil.example.com/rdkcentral/hal-doxygen, which is a different project, while
#      a single-string comparison rejects the equivalent https:// and ssh:// spellings of
#      the real one. A local filesystem origin is refused, because a path authenticates
#      nothing about the content behind it.
#   3. IDENTITY. The pin names a tag, and a tag is a movable label, so resolving the name
#      proves nothing on its own: a checkout carrying a tag of the same name over other
#      content resolves it happily. The commit that tag must resolve to is recorded beside
#      the pin and asserted, and the checkout is then required to be DETACHED at exactly
#      that commit, so no branch tip can move underneath a later run.
#   4. INTEGRITY. `git checkout` keeps non-conflicting local modifications and untracked
#      additions, so a tampered Makefile, Doxyfile.cfg or header.html executes while HEAD
#      still reports the expected commit. The checkout must therefore be clean with
#      untracked files included; its git directory must be the ordinary directory inside
#      it, not a gitdir redirect pointing somewhere unverified; it must carry no local
#      configuration key or hook that lets git run a program of the checkout's choosing;
#      and no index entry may be marked assume-unchanged or skip-worktree, which would make
#      a modified tracked file report clean.
#   5. CONTAINMENT. ./build and ./output must both be real directories inside this docs/
#      directory. The generator's Doxyfile.cfg sets OUTPUT_DIRECTORY to ../output resolved
#      from ./build, so Doxygen writes the entire generated site through ./output, and a
#      symlink there - at its root or at any depth beneath it - redirects every one of
#      those writes out of the repository.
#   6. TIME OF CHECK VERSUS TIME OF USE. Containment, revision and cleanliness are
#      asserted again immediately before make, with nothing between them and the build, so
#      a concurrent writer cannot substitute a different tree between verification and use.
#   7. DIAGNOSTICS. Every URL this script prints passes through redact_url, so a remote
#      configured with credentials in its userinfo - https://user:token@host/path - is
#      reported by host and path and the credential does not reach a terminal or a build
#      log. For the same reason no refusal echoes the version string it rejected: that
#      string is attacker-chosen data, and a log is a place other tools read.
#
# Nothing is fetched, and nothing outside ./output is written, when ./build is already the
# pinned generator: an established checkout builds with no network access at all.

# later run is checked against. The SSH spelling is the corpus convention and is kept; the
# host-and-path check below also accepts the equivalent https:// and ssh:// spellings,
# because a checkout provisioned over either is the same project.
HAL_GENERATOR_URL="git@github.com:rdkcentral/hal-doxygen.git"

# In the future this should moved to a fixed verison
#
# `develop` is a BRANCH, and a branch is not a pin: it names whatever commit it points at
# now, so the generator that builds this documentation today need not be the generator that
# built it yesterday. The plan keeps this repository on `develop` and puts changing that
# out of scope for this work - the pin stays as it is, with its commit resolved for the run
# rather than the pin rewritten - so the ref is AUTHENTICATED here instead of replaced:
#
#   * the branch tip is resolved once per run from the remote this script has already
#     established is the official generator, with `git ls-remote refs/heads/develop`, and
#     the local checkout is then required to be detached at exactly that commit;
#   * where no remote can be reached - an offline build host, or one with no deploy key -
#     an operator may state the commit they intend to build with
#     HAL_GENERATOR_EXPECTED_COMMIT=<40 hex characters>, which is then treated as the pin
#     and reported as such;
#   * and when neither is available the build is REFUSED. A moving ref cannot be
#     authenticated offline, and "build whatever develop is now" is precisely the exposure
#     these controls exist to remove.
#
# The residual, stated rather than hidden: `develop` can still move upstream between runs,
# so two runs weeks apart may legitimately build different generator revisions, each of
# them authenticated against the tip at the time. Every run prints the commit it resolved
# and built, which is what makes that visible in a build log. Closing it for good means
# pinning a tag or a commit here, and that is the plan's decision to make rather than this
# script's.
